#### CREATING A GIT REPOSITORY
# switching to another disk
cd f:
 mkdir git-training-v1
cd git-training-v1
touch ex1-forloop.py
ls
touch ex2-dfunction.py
# creagting the repo
git init  ----this will create a .git in the folder making it a git repository(note it might be an hidden item)
git status  ---- to check the status of our git repo
# opening your git on vscode
code git-training-v1/
# opening your git on vscode from the git repository
code .

to create other brnaches , use git checkout -b 'name of your branch'
to move between branches git checkout name of your branch
 git branch shows you a list of your brnaches

 git diff shows the different versions of the code and changes made between branches
